# About

Hello, hello! And welcome to my blog! :smiley:

My name is Fernando, and I'm a software engineer currently living in Brazil.
Here, in my blog, I talk about everything about programming, machine learning, and data science.
There is not much more to say here. But, if you're interested, please check some of my posts!
And, please, enjoy your stay!
Cheers! :grin:
